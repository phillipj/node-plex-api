# plex-api [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/phillipj/node-plex-api.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/phillipj/node-plex-api)

Small module which helps you query the Plex Media Server HTTP API.

## Usage

```bash
$ npm install plex-api --save
```

**PlexAPI(options | hostname)**

Instantiate a PlexAPI client.

The parameter can be a string representing the server's hostname, or an object with the following properties:

Options:
- **hostname**: hostname where Plex Server runs
- **port**: port number Plex Server is listening on (optional, default: `32400`)
- **https**: (optional, default: `false`)
- **username**: plex.tv username (optional / required for PlexHome)
- **password**: plex.tv password (optional / required for PlexHome)
- **managedUser**: details required to perform operations as a managed PlexHome user
	- **name**: managed user name
	- **pin**: optional pin code for the managed user
- **token**: plex.tv authentication token (optional)
- **timeout**: timeout value in milliseconds to use when making requests (optional)
- **options**: override additional PlexHome options (optional, but recommended for PlexHome)
	- **identifier**: A unique client identifier. Default is a `generated uuid v4`. *Note: you should really provide this rather than let it get generated. Every time your app runs, a new "device" will get registered on your Plex account, which can lead to poor performance once hundreds or thousands of them get created. Trust me!*
	- **product**: The name of your application. Official Plex examples: `Plex Web`, `Plex Home Theater`, `Plex for Xbox One`. Default `Node.js App`
	- **version**: The version of your app. Default `1.0`
	- **deviceName**: The "name" of the device your app is running on. For apps like Plex Home Theater and mobile apps, it's the computer or phone's name chosen by the user. Default `Node.js App`
	- **platform**: The platform your app is running on. The use of this is inconsistent in the official Plex apps. It is not displayed on the web interface. Official Plex examples: `Chrome`, `Plex Home Theater`, `Windows`. Default is `Node.js`.
	- **platformVersion**: The platform version. Default is the version of Node running.
	- **device**: The name of the type of computer your app is running on, usually the OS name. Official Plex examples: `Windows`, `iPhone`, `Xbox One`. Default is whatever `os.platform()` returns.

Here's an example of what an app shows up as on the Plex web interface

![Plex Device Example](docs/plex-device-example.png?raw)

The rows in that example from top to bottom are `deviceName`, `version`, `product`, and `device`.

### .query(options)

**Retrieve content from URI**

The parameter can be a string representing the URI, or an object with the following properties:
- **uri**: the URI to query
- (optional) **extraHeaders**: an object with extra headers to send in the HTTP request. Useful for things like X-Plex-Target-Client-Identifier

Aside from requesting the API and returning its response, an `.uri` property are created to easier follow the URIs available in the HTTP API. At the moment URIs are attached for Directory and Server items.

```js
var PlexAPI = require("plex-api");
var client = new PlexAPI("192.168.0.1");

client.query("/").then(function (result) {
	console.log("%s running Plex Media Server v%s",
		result.friendlyName,
		result.version);

	// array of children, such as Directory or Server items
	// will have the .uri-property attached
	console.log(result._children);
}, function (err) {
	console.error("Could not connect to server", err);
});
```

### .postQuery(options)

**Send a POST request and retrieve the response**

This is identical to `query()`, except that the request will be a POST rather than a GET. It has the same required and optional parameters as `query()`.

Note that the parameters can only be passed as a query string as part of the uri, which is all Plex requires. (`Content-Length` will always be zero)

```js
var PlexAPI = require("plex-api");
var client = new PlexAPI("192.168.0.1");

client.postQuery("/playQueue?type=video&uri=someuri&shuffle=0").then(function (result) {
	console.log("Added video to playQueue %s",
		result.playQueueID);

	// array of children, such as Directory or Server items
	// will have the .uri-property attached
	console.log(result._children);
}, function (err) {
	console.error("Could not connect to server", err);
});
```

### .putQuery(options)

**Send a PUT request and retrieve the response**

This is identical to `query()`, except that the request will be a PUT rather than a GET. It has the same required and optional parameters as `query()`. It's is used to update parts of your Plex library.

Note that the parameters can only be passed as a query string as part of the uri, which is all Plex requires. (`Content-Length` will always be zero)

```js
var PlexAPI = require("plex-api");
var client = new PlexAPI("192.168.0.1");

client.putQuery("/library/sections/3/all?type=1&id=123&summary.value=updatedSummaryText")
	.then(function (result) {
		console.log("Description of video by id 123 has been set to 'updatedSummaryText'");
	}, function (err) {
		console.error("Could not connect to server", err);
	});
```

### .perform(options)

**Perform an API action**

When performing an "action" on the HTTP API, the response body will be empty.
As the response content itself is worthless, `perform()` acts on the HTTP status codes the server responds with.
It has the same required and optional parameters as `query()`.

```js
var PlexAPI = require("plex-api");
var client = new PlexAPI("192.168.0.1");

// update library section of key "1"
client.perform("/library/sections/1/refresh").then(function () {
	// successfully started to refresh library section #1
}, function (err) {
	console.error("Could not connect to server", err);
});
```

### .find(options, [{criterias}])

**Find matching child items on URI**

Uses `query()` behind the scenes, giving all directories and servers the beloved `.uri` property. It has the same required and optional parameters as `query`, in addition to a second optional `criterias` parameter.

```js
var PlexAPI = require("plex-api");
var client = new PlexAPI("192.168.0.1");

// filter directories on Directory attributes
client.find("/library/sections", {type: "movie"}).then(function (directories) {
	// directories would be an array of sections whose type are "movie"
}, function (err) {
	console.error("Could not connect to server", err);
});

// criterias are interpreted as regular expressions
client.find("/library/sections", {type: "movie|shows"}).then(function (directories) {
	// directories type would be "movie" OR "shows"
}, function (err) {
	console.error("Could not connect to server", err);
});

// shorthand to retrieve all Directories
client.find("/").then(function (directories) {
	// directories would be an array of Directory items
}, function (err) {
	throw new Error("Could not connect to server");
});
```

## Authenticators

An authenticator is used by plex-api to authenticate its request against Plex Servers with a PlexHome setup. The most common authentication mechanism is by username and password.

You can provide your own custom authentication mechanism, read more about custom authenticators below.

### Credentials: username and password

Comes bundled with plex-api. Just provide `options.username` and `options.password` when creating a PlexAPI instance and you are good to go.

See the [plex-api-credentials](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plex-api-credentials) module for more information about its inner workings.

### PIN: authenticate by PIN code

An authentication module that provides an interface for authenticating with Plex using a PIN, like the official clients do.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/plex-api-pinauth

### Custom authenticator

In its simplest form an `authenticator` is an object with **one required** function `authenticate()` which should return the autentication token needed by plex-api to satisfy Plex Server.

An optional method `initialize()` could be implemented if you need reference to the created PlexAPI instance when it's created.

```js
{
  // OPTIONAL
  initialize: function(plexApi) {
    // plexApi === the PlexAPI instance just created
  },
  // REQUIRED
  authenticate: function(plexApi, callback) {
    // plexApi === the PlexAPI instance requesting the authentication token

    // invoke callback if something fails
    if (somethingFailed) {
      return callback(new Error('I haz no cluez about token!'));
    }

    // or when you have a token
    callback(null, 'I-found-this-token');
  }
}
```

## HTTP API Documentation
For more information about the API capabilities, see the [unofficial Plex API documentation](https://github.com/Arcanemagus/plex-api/wiki). The [PlexInc's desktop client wiki](https://github.com/plexinc/plex-media-player/wiki/Remote-control-API) might also be valueable.

## Running tests

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm test
```

Automatically run all tests whenever files has been changed:
```shell
$ npm run test:watch
```
